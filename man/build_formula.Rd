\item{covariates}{List of strings of GAM covariates, not including
the smoothing terms over nodes and the random effect due to subjectID.
This list can also include smoothing terms.}

\item{additional_terms}{Smoothing terms, not including
the smoothing terms over nodes and the random effect due to subjectID.}

\item{group_by}{The grouping variable used to group nodeID smoothing terms}

\item{participant_id}{The name of the column that encodes participant ID}

\item{k}{Dimension of the basis used to represent the node smoothing term}
