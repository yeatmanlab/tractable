This vignette demonstrates how a GAM model changes with increased flexibility.
The data we will use here contains tract profiles from diffusion MRI
measurements in a group of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
and a group of matched controls [@Sarica2017].

We start by loading the `tractr` library and `gratia`, as well as `ggplot2`,
which we will use to interpret the fitted model.

```{r setup}
library(tractr)
library(gratia)
library(ggplot2)
```

Next, we will use a function that is included in `tractr` to read this dataset
directly into memory. Importantly, both the group ("ALS" or "CTRL") and the
subject identifier ("subjectID") need to be factors for subsequent analysis
to work properly.

```{r}
sarica <- tractr::read.afq.sarica()
sarica$group <- factor(sarica$class)
sarica$subjectID <- unclass(factor(sarica$subjectID))
```

We fit models with different levels of flexibility, encoded in different values
of `k`:

```{r}

k_values = c(4, 8, 16, 32)

models = list()

for (ii in seq_along(k_values)){
   models[[ii]] <- tractr_single_bundle(df_afq = sarica,
                                        tract = "Right Corticospinal",
                                        participant_id = "subjectID",
                                        group_by = "group",
                                        covariates = c("age", "group"),
                                        dwi_metric = "fa",
                                        k = k_values[ii])

}
```

And we plot the smooths, divided by group for each one of these levels:

```{r}

plots =list()

for (ii in seq_along(k_values)){

sm <- smooth_estimates(models[[ii]]) %>%
  gratia::add_confint()

plots[[ii]] <- sm %>%
      ggplot() +
      geom_ribbon(aes(group=group, ymin = lower_ci, ymax = upper_ci, x = nodeID),
                  alpha = 0.2) +
      geom_line(aes(group=group, color=group, x = nodeID, y = est))+
  labs(y = "FA", title = sprintf("k=%d", k_values[ii]))

}

plots
```
